	I am reading this book to learn how to develop websites that can 
	<br>be accessed from any device and can serve as cross-platform 
	<br>apps.
	<br>The devices I test will be running the following operating 
	<br>systems:

	<br>


	<br>Apple iOS

	<br>Google Android

	<br>Blackberry OS

	<br>Microsoft Windows Phone OS
